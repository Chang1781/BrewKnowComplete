The phone gap plugin for social sharing I am adding to my app is supposed to allow you to share images, text, or links if applicable. This means you would be able to share the brews you liked with people on social media.It would also give you the ability to share your user link if the app was designed for user login with an option to share your saved brews via a link to your profile with other people. This is the concept behind the app and would allow you to save and share this information with many people.
